HydroFlow.Solutions is an Internet of Water Things and Predictive Analytics platform observing the real-time water flow and providing intelligent actions to boost water conservation from each individual home to the community and to the world. 

### IoWT 
The frontend component integrates Water Flow sensors and Arduino to provide realtime water flow data to the HydroFlow Agent

### HydroFlow Agent
The IoWT gateway that provides REST API endpoints, transforms data, and loads water information into Time Series DBMS. 

### HydroFlow Apps
A collection of Mobile Apps provide highly friendly UX for users to configure devices and to get access to dashboards. There are 3 apps for Smart Home, Agriculture, and I-IoT (Industrial).

### HydraFlow Dashboard
Designed to provide intuitive and comprehensive graphical water flow information for overall usage and device-location-category based displays. 

### HydroFlow Water Intelligence
Configurable rules to provide realtime alerts and designed actions (potentially via IFTTT to integrate with other IoT devices)

### HydroFlow ETL

Scales the system to establish Data Warehouses for further compiling and disseminating the Big Water Data, i.e. National Water Data repository, for advanced researches.
